# Project Context: Host/Guest Rental Platform (Frontend Only)

You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.
You are building the frontend for a web platform allowing short-term rental hosts to centralize property information for their guests.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Component Library:** Shadcn UI (Radix UI based).
- **Icons:** Lucide React.
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation.
- **State Management:** React Context or Zustand (for simulating Auth/Global state).
- **Date Handling:** date-fns.

## Core Objective
Build a responsive, polished, and interactive frontend. Since there is no Backend, **you must simulate all API calls, authentication, and database interactions** using mock data, local storage, or timeouts.

## User Roles & Flows

### 1. Host (Private Area)
- **Auth (Simulated):**
  - Login page (Email/Password).
  - Forgot password page (UI only).
  - Pre-defined mock credentials (e.g., `admin@host.com` / `password`).
- **Dashboard:**
  - View list of properties with status badges (Draft vs. Published).
  - Button to "Create New Property".
  - Actions: Edit, Delete (with confirmation).
- **Property Management (CRUD):**
  - **Forms:** Split into sections (General Info, Check-in/out, Wifi, Amenities, Rules, Contacts, Local Recs).
  - **Status Logic:** A property is "Draft" by default.
  - **Payment Flow (UI Mock):** To switch from "Draft" to "Published", the user must click "Publish & Pay". Show a mock payment modal/spinner, then update status to "Published".
  - **Output:** Once published, generate a unique link (e.g., `/guest/property-id`).

### 2. Guest (Public View)
- **Access:** Via unique link (no login required).
- **Design:** Mobile-first, clean, read-only.
- **Content:** Display all property info clearly (Wifi, Codes, Maps, etc.).
- **Restrictions:** No interactive forms for guests, strictly informational.

## UI/UX Guidelines
- **Mobile First:** The Guest view must look perfect on mobile.
- **Professional:** Clean aesthetic, good whitespace, distinct typography.
- **Feedback:** Use Toasts (Sonner) for success/error messages.
- **Loading States:** Use Skeletons while "fetching" mock data.
- **Empty States:** specialized UI when no properties exist.

## Data Simulation Rules (IMPORTANT)
- Create a `lib/mock-data.ts` or similar service.
- Define strictly typed Interfaces (`Property`, `User`, `Amenity`).
- Simulate network latency (e.g., `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000))`) before returning data to show loading states.
- Persist data in `localStorage` if possible so the user doesn't lose progress on refresh, otherwise use in-memory state.

## Coding Standards
- Use **Functional Components** with named exports.
- Use `shadcn` components for everything (Card, Button, Input, Form, Badge, Dialog, Separator).
- Implement responsive layouts using Tailwind utility classes.
- Keep Client Components (`"use client"`) at the leaves of the tree where possible.
- Handle "Not Found" and "Error" pages.

## Implementation Steps
1. Setup layout and basic routing (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(guest)`).
2. Create reusable UI components using Shadcn.
3. Build the Auth pages (Login).
4. Build the Dashboard (List view).
5. Build the detailed Property Form (with Zod validation).
6. Implement the "Mock Payment" and State transition (Draft -> Published).
7. Build the Public Guest Page (Mobile optimized).
